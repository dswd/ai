# Changelog

## v0.1.0 – Initial Release

**Project:** CLI interface for interacting with AI models, powered by `rig-core` with tool-use capabilities.

### Features

- **Multi-provider support:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Groq, DeepSeek, Google (Gemini), Mistral, OpenRouter, and xAI (Grok).
- **Interactive & one-shot modes:** Run with a direct prompt, pipe input via stdin, or launch an interactive session with persistent history.
- **Session management:** Save, list, continue, and delete sessions with message history and system prompt preservation.
- **Tool system:**
  - **Execute tool** – Run shell commands with configurable timeout, offset/limit output control, and support for multiple commands.
  - **Filesystem tools** – Read/write/search files with policy-based access restrictions.
  - **Web tool** – Fetch URLs and search the web, with pattern-based allowlisting.
  - **Memory tool** – Persistent agent memory stored to disk and injected into the system prompt.
  - **Think tool** – Extended reasoning capability.
- **Policy engine:** Granular permission system controlling file access (read/write), command execution (glob patterns), and web access (fetch/search URLs). Supports policy files and CLI overrides.
- **Config management:** YAML-based configuration, interactive `--init` wizard for setting up providers, API keys, models, and context windows.
- **CLI flags:** `--memory`, `--session`, `--interactive`, `--thinking`, `--max-tokens`, `--max-turns`, `--verbose`/`--quiet`, `--list`, `--delete`, `--tool` (for external MCP tool servers), `--policy`, `--yolo` (allow-all mode).
- **Output control:** Offset/limit pagination, hard caps (200 lines / 100 KB), and truncation notices for all tool outputs.
- **Logging:** `log` crate-based logging with emoji icons, color-coded levels, and configurable verbosity.
- **CI/CD:** Gitea workflows for audit, CI (build & test), and release automation.
- **Cross-platform:** Windows policy path handling, cross-compilation fixes.

### Infrastructure
